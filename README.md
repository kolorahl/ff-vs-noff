# test

Testing some git merging and rebasing stuff. This is fun!

Now we're doing some branch work. Branches that merge with no-ff look ugly.

Now we commit with ff (fast-forward) enabled; but what about conflicts? We resolve them as usual with merges.

Another merge with no conflicts! If you are using `git rebase` with your development branches, this is what your git commit history should look like: clean. A straight line. Immaculate.
